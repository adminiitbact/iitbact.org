              Anyone who wants to, you DONâ€™T have to be from IIT Bombay to do
              this. We have named the group IIT B ACT because we believe that
              there is a lot of value we can extract out of tapping into the IIT
              Bombay network of students and alumni.
              <br />
              <br /> The skills we are currently looking for: web developers,
              software engineers, designers, marketing experts, supply-chain
              management experts, entrepreneurs, manufacturing enthusiasts,
              social workers, data scientists, economists, biomedical engineers,
              doctors and the list goes on and on.
